# About

Hi there!

I'm Nathan LeClaire, a grade A nerd who has worked on everything from Linux
containers to infrastructure to webapps.

I originally learned a bit of C++, Linux, and Python as a teenager, but it
eventually snowballed into all kinds of stuff (after a brief detour into a
Philosophy degree), and nowadays I mostly program in Golang .

Currently I'm working at [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io).

Areas of interest for me in computing include:

* Distributed Systems
* Machine Learning
* Security
* Kernel Programming & Virtualization

I enjoy getting e-mail, feel free to <a
href="mailto:nathanleclaire@gmail.com">send me one</a>.  Thanks for visiting!
